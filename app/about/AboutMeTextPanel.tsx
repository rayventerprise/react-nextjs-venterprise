          I began this journey at the ripe age of 12, developing a deep passion for software development. Over the past decade, I have gained extensive experience across the front-end, back-end, mobile development, and digital marketing.
          <br/><br/>
          One of my notable achievements was selling a side project that grew to over a million monthly views, which taught me invaluable lessons in scaling and rapid iteration.
          <br/><br/>
          Iâ€™ve led teams to success as an engineering manager and equally enjoy contributing to projects at all levels as an individual contributor.<br/>
